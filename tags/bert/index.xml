      <description>There are quite a few BERT vs GPT-2 breakdowns online, mostly focusing on the architectural differences between the two models. However, I am more interested in the performance differences between the two models, specifically their predictive capabilities. This blog post outlines the results of my experiments.&#xA;The code used in this experiment can be found on my Github&#xA;BERT The Devlin et al. model was released in November 2018. It is a transformer-based language model pretrained on masked input (also known as the cloze task).</description>

      <description>TLDR: Attention masks allow us to send a batch into the transformer even when the examples in the batch have varying lengths. We do this by padding all sequences to the same length, then using the &amp;ldquo;attention_mask&amp;rdquo; tensor to identify which tokens are padding.&#xA;Here we use a batch with three samples padded from the left since we want to predict the next token on the right. (Padding on the right would probably predict another pad.</description>
