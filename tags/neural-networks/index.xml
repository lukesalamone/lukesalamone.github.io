      <description>Autoencoding stock prices as found in Heaton et al., 2016
  So you want to build an autoencoder? Great! This article will demonstrate how to build an autoencoder and use it to measure stock prices against an index. This technique is described in more technical terms here.
Once we&amp;rsquo;ve trained the autoencoder, we can use it to measure how well each component follows the other members of the index.</description>

      <description>The following is a transcript of the above video
In this paper, the authors present a novel neural network architecture to enable audio search via sounds humans are able to make, for example humming and whistling. This is an important capability when searching through audio for a specific sound.
Motivation Imagine you have hundreds of unlabeled sound effects on your computer, and you are looking for a specific one.</description>
