      <description>This is part 1 of a paper I wrote for Ken Forbus&amp;rsquo; Qualitative Reasoning course, adapted for this blog. You can find a printable version of the paper here and part 2 here.
Computers that play chess, otherwise known as chess engines, have existed since at least the late 1940s. Because the game was said to require the perfect combination of planning, strategy, psychology, and calculation, chess was once thought to be an activity directly correlated with intelligence, and that only a truly intelligent computer should be able to defeat humans.</description>

      <title>Creating an AI for Gomoku</title>

      <description>Gomoku is a strategy game similar to tic tac toe, but played on a larger board and with the goal of getting 5 in a row rather than 3. Since the game has perfect information and has simple rules, I thought it would be a fun exercise in creating a game AI. In February 2020 I decided to code up Gomoku2049. The game is a demonstration of MiniMax, which is an algorithm for finding the move which minimizes the opponentâ€™s best moves.</description>
