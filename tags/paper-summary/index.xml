      <description>This is a summary of Automated Antenna Design with Evolutionary Algorithms, a 2006 paper by Hornby et al. As large language models become more and more synonymous with &amp;ldquo;AI&amp;rdquo;, it is interesting to see how researchers solved problems in the past.&#xA;Typically, antennas are designed and built by hand by domain experts. This is a very time-consuming process, however, so researchers have been investigating evolutionary algorithms since the 1990s. Inspired by natural evolution, an evolutionary algorithm is based on small, random changes and an evaluation metric.</description>
