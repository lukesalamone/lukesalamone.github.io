      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12616&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Defending Against Neural Fake News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Zellers et al. presents a model for controllable text generation called Grover. This model can be used to create highly believable computer-generated news articles. The authors present this paper as a method of detecting and preventing the spread of fake news. They claim their model is 92% accurate at detecting fake news stories, partially due to artifacts that generators include in the generated text.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>BERT vs GPT-2 Performance</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are quite a few BERT vs GPT-2 breakdowns online, mostly focusing on the architectural differences between the two models. However, I am more interested in the performance differences between the two models, specifically their predictive capabilities. This blog post outlines the results of my experiments.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/lukesalamone/gpt2-vs-bert&#34;&gt;The code used in this experiment can be found on my Github&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;bert&#34;&gt;BERT&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.04805.pdf&#34;&gt;Devlin et al. model&lt;/a&gt; was released in November 2018. It is a transformer-based language model pretrained on masked input (also known as the &lt;em&gt;cloze&lt;/em&gt; task). During pretraining, 15% of tokens are hidden from the model, and it is trained to predict the masked tokens. As a result, I was able to evaluate its ability to correctly predict a masked token at a random position in a fixed-size input.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How does GPT-2 Tokenize Text?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s explore how GPT-2 tokenizes text.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-tokenization&#34;&gt;What is tokenization?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s important to understand that GPT-2 doesn&amp;rsquo;t work with strings directly. Instead, it needs to tokenize the input string, which is essentially a process for converting the string into a list of numbers, or &amp;ldquo;tokens&amp;rdquo;. It is these tokens which are passed into the model during training or for inference. As a concrete example, let&amp;rsquo;s look at a few sample sentences:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What Are Attention Masks?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;TLDR: Attention masks allow us to send a batch into the transformer even when the examples in the batch have varying lengths. We do this by padding all sequences to the same length, then using the &amp;ldquo;attention_mask&amp;rdquo; tensor to identify which tokens are padding.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;../../img/attention_mask.png&#34;&#xA;    alt=&#34;Here we use a batch with three samples padded from the left since we want to predict the next token on the right. (Padding on the right would probably predict another pad.)&#34;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&#xA;      &lt;p&gt;Here we use a batch with three samples padded from the left since we want to predict the next token on the right.
