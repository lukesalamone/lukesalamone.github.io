      <description>Chess has been played in different forms since the seventh century, and in its modern form since the nineteenth century. Opening theory, i.e. the study of the best moves to begin the game with, has been developing since then.
The EGG Opening I was inspired the other day after watching a video by Eric Rosen called &amp;ldquo;Quadruple Egg&amp;rdquo;. Chess boards are usually notated from left to right with the letters A through H.</description>

      <title>What is Marginalization?</title>

      <description>In machine learning and statistics, marginalization simply means summing over a set of independent variables. For example, suppose an avid tennis player kept track of the number of days he played tennis over a period of time as well as the weather on that day:
 .blue { background-color:#09f1; } .gray { background-color:#80808012; }    weather     sunny cloudy rainy totals   play? yes 70 25 1 96  no 70 5 9 84  totals 140 30 10 180   (In this table we&amp;rsquo;re keeping track of the number of days.</description>

Lower is better.
In natural language processing, perplexity is the most common metric used to measure the performance of a language model.</description>

      <title>What is the Hardest Hangman Word?</title>
      <link>https://lukesalamone.github.io/posts/hardest-hangman-word/</link>

      <guid>https://lukesalamone.github.io/posts/hardest-hangman-word/</guid>
      <description>It seems like a simple enough question. Which word should you choose so that it takes your opponent the most guesses to discover it? Should you choose a long word to use up your opponent&amp;rsquo;s guesses? Or perhaps a short word with obscure letters? In this document I look into this question. But first, a bit of background.
If you&amp;rsquo;re not familiar with the rules of hangman, it is a guessing game played between two people.</description>
