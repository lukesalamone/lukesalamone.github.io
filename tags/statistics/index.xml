      <description>What is a blunder in chess? The tension between the qualitative and quantitative answers to this question is at the heart of different approaches towards chess, and more broadly, how quantitative metrics may lack context, but qualitative metrics lack precision.
Qualitative answer There are many qualitative answers to this question, especially when comparing &amp;ldquo;blunders&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;mistakes&amp;rdquo;:
 &amp;ldquo;a move that negatively affects their position in a significant way&amp;rdquo; ~ chess.com &amp;ldquo;severely worsens the player&amp;rsquo;s situation by allowing a loss of material, checkmate, or anything similar&amp;rdquo; ~ Wikipedia &amp;ldquo;Blunders tend to be immediately refutable, while mistakes require planning to capitalize on.</description>

      <title>Alphabet Chess</title>

      <description>TLDR: Alphabet chess is a chess variant that allows handicapping by mixing in a bit of poker into the beginning of the game. Moves must be played according to a secret word at the beginning of the game.
Chess has been played in different forms since the seventh century, and in its modern form since the nineteenth century. Opening theory, i.e. the study of the best moves to begin the game with, has been developing since then.</description>

      <title>What is Marginalization?</title>

      <description>In machine learning and statistics, marginalization simply means summing over a set of independent variables. For example, suppose an avid tennis player kept track of the number of days he played tennis over a period of time as well as the weather on that day:
 .blue { background-color:#09f1; } .gray { background-color:#80808012; }    weather     sunny cloudy rainy totals   play? yes 70 25 1 96  no 70 5 9 84  totals 140 30 10 180   (In this table we&amp;rsquo;re keeping track of the number of days.</description>

Lower is better.
In natural language processing, perplexity is the most common metric used to measure the performance of a language model.</description>

      <title>What is the Hardest Hangman Word?</title>
      <link>https://lukesalamone.github.io/posts/hardest-hangman-word/</link>

      <guid>https://lukesalamone.github.io/posts/hardest-hangman-word/</guid>
      <description>It seems like a simple enough question. Which word should you choose so that it takes your opponent the most guesses to discover it? Should you choose a long word to use up your opponent&amp;rsquo;s guesses? Or perhaps a short word with obscure letters? In this document I look into this question. But first, a bit of background.
If you&amp;rsquo;re not familiar with the rules of hangman, it is a guessing game played between two people.</description>

The value of the mathematical constant Pi is a good example of this: although it is possible to calculate the exact value of Pi, a good estimate is easily demonstrated with just a few lines of code.</description>
