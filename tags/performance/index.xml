      <description>K-means clustering (previous discussion) is an unsupervised learning algorithm which assigns points to one of K different clusters based on the distance of that point to a centroid. The points may represent physical locations, or embeddings in high-dimensional vector space.&#xA;ðŸŒŸCheck out the demo (in two dimensions) below. Centroids are colored white.ðŸŒŸ&#xA;start Note that the points are changing color only, not moving.&#xA;General algorithm The basic K-means algorithm is fairly simple and has two steps, repeated until convergence (i.</description>
