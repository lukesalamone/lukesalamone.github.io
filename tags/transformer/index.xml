      <description>A self-attention block depicted as a neural network.
  In this post I will describe the attention mechanism, commonly used in transformers, a popular neural language architecture. Most of the most well-known large language models of late are based on the transformer architecture. Attention was first described in Attention is All You Need by Vaswani et al.
What is attention? At a high level, attention is a mechanism for neural networks to boost portions of an input which are relevant and ignore those which aren&amp;rsquo;t.</description>

      <description>Selected {subject, relation, object} tuples generated by COMET
  Paper link: https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.05317
This paper discusses a method of generating knowledge bases automatically. Previous work largely focused on encyclopedic knowledge, which has well-defined relationships. This paper, however, focuses on commonsense knowledge. In this paper the authors introduce a “commonsense transformer” which trains on a knowledge base consisting of tuples and a pre-trained language model. Their trained model generates new nodes in the knowledge graph and completes phrases based on edges in the existing graph.</description>
