      <title>A 3D Game of Life</title>

      <description>Conway&amp;rsquo;s Game of Life is a simulation developed in 1970 describing a grid of binary cells and transition rules for each cell which depend on the state of the cell&amp;rsquo;s neighbors. It&amp;rsquo;s capable of creating some pretty cool patterns.
This variant of the Game of Life uses three overlapping channels, so instead of just one simulation, there are three simultaneous simulations. I visualize these in the three color channels, red, green and blue.</description>

      <description>Need to switch between python versions often? Use pyenv.
Installing pyenv # install pyenv curl https://pyenv.run | bash # check pyenv install location which pyenv  Install another python version # see a list of available python versions pyenv install --list # check installed python versions pyenv versions # installs python 3.7.5 pyenv install 3.7.5  Switch python versions # use python 3.7.5 everywhere on your machine pyenv global 3.7.5 # use python 3.</description>

      <title>What is the Hardest Hangman Word?</title>

      <description>It seems like a simple enough question. Which word should you choose so that it takes your opponent the most guesses to discover it? Should you choose a long word to use up your opponent&amp;rsquo;s guesses? Or perhaps a short word with obscure letters? In this document I look into this question. But first, a bit of background.
If you&amp;rsquo;re not familiar with the rules of hangman, it is a guessing game played between two people.</description>

The value of the mathematical constant Pi is a good example of this: although it is possible to calculate the exact value of Pi, a good estimate is easily demonstrated with just a few lines of code.</description>

      <title>Creating an AI for Gomoku</title>
      <link>https://lukesalamone.github.io/posts/gomoku2049/</link>

      <description>Gomoku is a strategy game similar to tic tac toe, but played on a larger board and with the goal of getting 5 in a row rather than 3. Since the game has perfect information and has simple rules, I thought it would be a fun exercise in creating a game AI. In February 2020 I decided to code up Gomoku2049. The game is a demonstration of MiniMax, which is an algorithm for finding the move which minimizes the opponentâ€™s best moves.</description>
