      <description>I spent some time considering words to describe a chess position with many legal moves. &amp;ldquo;Complex&amp;rdquo; doesn&amp;rsquo;t quite capture the situation since we would usually describe a complex position as one with many tactical interations. Ramified seems to make the most sense, as it describes &amp;ldquo;branching out&amp;rdquo;.
The opening position in chess has 20 legal moves. From there, the number of legal moves in a position tends to increase as pieces move towards the center of the board, before decreasing as the number of pieces on the board drops in the endgame.</description>
