      <description>Suppose we have a vector database with a billion items in it (the haystack). And suppose we are looking for K vectors, the needles which maximize some similarity function. (In the case of cosine similarity or euclidean distance, we may be maximizing 1-distance(x,y).) And also suppose that we&amp;rsquo;d like to do this quickly.
Naive and semi-naive approaches One approach might be to compare every vector and take the argmax. In that case, for vectors of length D our runtime will be 1 billion x D.</description>
