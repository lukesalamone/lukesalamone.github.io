        <p>DeepSeek R1 is a large language model which employs test-time compute to generate a response. Unlike many decoder-based models in the past which simply continue the given text (and may be fine-tuned for conversation), R1 generates reasoning tokens before the final answer is given. According to the researchers, its performance is on par with OpenAI&rsquo;s O1 model.</p>
<h2 id="terminology">Terminology</h2>
<p>First, I will briefly describe some terminology related to training techniques:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Supervised fine-tuning (SFT)</strong> is a process which uses input/output pairs to directly fine-tune a model. In a reinforcement learning setting, SFT can help to mitigate cold start issues by providing initial policy behavior prior to RL training. The downside of SFT is that the input/output pairs can be expensive to acquire.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Preference fine-tuning</strong> involves training a model using preferences between different outputs for the same input. Usually these preferences are human-generated. Relative quality assessments are easier for humans to make, but are still a valuable training signal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Rejection sampling fine-tuning (RFT)</strong> is a method for generating synthetic training data. First, a model produces k diverse candidate completions for a prompt using temperature sampling. Next, a reward model ranks or selects the best completions for training data.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the simplest version, this technique simply generates k <code>(reasoning, answer)</code> pairs for each prompt using a nonzero temperature (e.g. 0.7) and filters out incorrect answers. <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.01825">Paper</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Large scale reinforcement learning (RL)</strong>, as DeepSeek refers to it, is a training method which which assigns synthetic labels to a response based on easily-verified outcomes from reasoning problems such as correctness and formatting.</p>
<ul>
<li>This is in contrast to a supervised learning approach, which would typically enforce strict token-level matching.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are a few terms related to model architecture:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Mixture of Experts (MoE)</strong> is an architecture which uses a &ldquo;router&rdquo; to select from a pool of candidate &ldquo;expert&rdquo; networks.</p>
<ul>
<li>In a typical decoder transformer such as GPT-2 is simply a tall stack of decoder blocks, where 100% of the weights are activated for each token. In this paradigm, making the model bigger either means making bigger blocks or a taller stack of them, which both increase inference costs.</li>
<li>However, replacing simple decoder blocks with MoE blocks allows models to include more parameters without significantly increasing inference costs, since only a fraction of experts are active at any one time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA)</strong> is an alternative to traditional multihead attention which improves inference efficiency by using a low-rank approximation for the KV cache.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="paper-links">Paper links</h2>
<p>The release of R1 follows other papers from DeepSeek which go into extensive depth regarding many of the primatives discussed above. They&rsquo;re worth a read:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.04434">DeepSeek-V2</a> introduces Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) and several Mixture of Experts (MoE) optimizations to improve load balancing at the device level and expert level.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03300">DeepSeekMath</a> discusses Rejection Sampling Fine-Tuning (RFT) and compares Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.19437v1">DeepSeek-V3</a> describes a multi-token training objective, improvements to MoE load balancing, SFT, RL for fine-tuning, and framework optimizations related to training efficiency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.12948">DeepSeek-R1</a> discusses training techniques (large-scale RL, SFT, and RFT) for training R1-Zero and R1.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-deepseek-r1-zero-was-trained">How DeepSeek R1-Zero was trained</h2>
<p>The researchers apply RL directly to the base model (DeepSeek v3) without any cold start data to generate DeepSeek R1-Zero. However, the researchers note poor formatting/readability and the mixing multiple languages in the reasoning outputs.</p>
<p>In the training process, the researchers reused the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm which they introduced in <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03300">their DeepSeekMath paper</a>. This algorithm requires less computational overhead since it does not require a critic, and is stable as it measures output performance relative to the group. Responses received rewards based on accuracy and correct formatting.</p>
<p>R1-Zero was required to adhere to the format <code>&lt;think&gt;&lt;/think&gt;&lt;answer&gt;&lt;/answer&gt;</code> when responding.</p>
<h2 id="how-deepseek-r1-was-trained">How DeepSeek R1 was trained</h2>
<p>To address the usability issues in R1 Zero, the researchers expanded on R1 Zero with a four step process:</p>
<ol>
<li>Supervised fine-tuning with a small number of R1-Zero outputs, cleaned by human annotators</li>
<li>Large scale RL, in the same way as R1 Zero. The language mixing issue returned, but the researchers mitigated it with a language consistency reward during training. This reward did result in a slight drop in performance, however.</li>
<li>Supervised fine-tuning data collected via rejection sampling. These prompts cover both reasoning and non-reasoning domains.
<ul>
<li>For reasoning domains (600k examples), only the correct response was retained.</li>
<li>For non-reasoning domains (200k samples) like writing, factual QA, translation, etc. the researchers reused techniques from DeepSeek v3: synthetic responses cleaned up with human annotators.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Further RL refinement for &ldquo;helpfullness and harmlessness&rdquo;:
<ul>
<li>For reasoning tasks, the researchers used rule-based rewards, as in R1-Zero.</li>
<li>For non-reasoning tasks, the researchers used reward models to capture preferences.</li>
<li>To optimize helpfulness, only the final summary was evaluated.</li>
<li>To optimize harmlessness, both the reasoning tokens and final summary were evaluated.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="further-distillation">Further Distillation</h2>
<p>Using the 800k inputs from step 3 above, the researchers generated outputs from R1. They then performed supervised fine-tuning on Qwen (1.5B, 7B, 14B, 32B) and Llama (8B and 70B).</p>
